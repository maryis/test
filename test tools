## note: ##

1- When doing Integration test, component test, or load test, sometimes we need to mock external dependencies. Some example tools:
MockServer(has docker image), Blazemeter, ...

2- When doing Integration test, component test, or load test, sometimes we need to spin up external dependencies as a container in current environment. A great library for this is TestContainer:
You can find all java based testcontainers here:
https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/localstack/
For example: 
- mockServer
- database
- localstack
- kafka
